# Hi there! 👋

Here is my portfolio 🚀🚀

It highlights my skills and abilities, you'll find my main technical stacks, my main projects and all the ways you can contact me.

💻 I developed it in React Js for the front-end and Node Js / Express for the back-end.

The project is hosted on render's free servers, so the connection with the back-end may seem 'slow' the first time because the servers go into standby mode. Just wait a few seconds and everything will be back to normal. ⌚️

## Enjoy! 😀
